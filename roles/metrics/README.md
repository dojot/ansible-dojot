# Observability Stack - Kubernetes

## About

This readme contains the steps for deploying [`Prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring application, [`Loki`](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) to aggregation logs, [`Promtail`] ('https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/') agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Grafana Loki instance or Grafana Cloud and [`Grafana`](https://grafana.com/grafana/) which is used for visualize and analyze metrics and logs generated by Prometheus and Loki.

## Disclaimer

With a focus on improving the service, aiming at greater maintainability and programmability of the solution. We started a refactoring of the service using [`Helm`](https://helm.sh/), initially we are porting grafana and then we will porte all the rest of the observability solution.

As the inclusion of services (Prometheus, Loki, Promtail and Grafana) is under development, some services are currently not being monitored. The following describes the services already implemented.

## Node Exporter

[`Node Exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is used for get host metrics from the host itself. In other words, the metrics obtained by Prometheus are directly related to hardware and operating system.

Available metrics:

* Service uptime;
* Number of CPU cores;
* Total amount of RAM;
* Total amount of containers;
* Disk usage percentage;
* RAM usage percentage;
* Total amount of SWAP;
* Network traffic (Sent and Received);
* CPU usage percentage;
* Total, free and avaliable RAM;
* Amount of RAM for I/O processes;
* Used space of available disks.

## cAdvisor

[`cAdvisor`](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) is an exporter developed by Google that provides metrics regarding resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers.

Available metrics:

* Current status of the container: ``Running``, ``Stopped`` and ``Paused``;
* Network traffic received by container;
* Network traffic sent by container;
* Percentage of RAM usage per container;
* Percentage of CPU usage per container;
* RSS Memory Usage per Container;
* RAM consumption table per container;
* Available RAM for each conatainer;
* RAM limit established for each container.

## For Kubernetes

For [`Kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/) we have several specific dashboards for monitoring the cluster, nodes, pods and others services, as mentioned below:

* k8s resources namespaces workloads;
* Dojot 100K;
* Locust;
* Vmq cluster;
* Vmq Nodes;
* k8s resources cluster;
* k8s resources namespaces pods;
* k8s resources namespaces pods;
* k8s resources workloads;
* k8s nodes;
* k8s persistent volumes;
* k8s pods;
* k8s statefulsets;
* k8s usemethod cluster;
* k8s usemethod node.


## Using the service

Since we are using Docker, it is natural that we will use its metrics. To set the Docker daemon as a Prometheus target, you need to specify the metrics-address in ``/etc/docker/daemon.json``.

The first step is editing the file ``/etc/docker/daemon.json``.

If the file does not exists, you need to create it.

If the file is empty, paste the following:

```json
{
  "metrics-addr" : "0.0.0.0:9323",
  "experimental" : true
}
```

If the file is not empty, add these two keys, making sure the resulting file is a valid JSON. Be careful that all lines must end with a comma "," except the last line.

In order for the changes to be applied it is necessary to restart the docker daemon and the docker itself.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

```
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

Since we are running Prometheus on localhost, in case we try to use the docker as localhost as well, Prometheus could understand that the metrics are inside the service itself (Prometheus) and then, could try to access port ``9323`` inside the Promethues container. To prevent this from happening we should use the default IP `172.17.0.1` of the **bridge** docker ``docker0``.

Before running make sure that the `docker0` IP is really the default (172.17.0.1) with the following command:

```
ip address show dev docker0
```

The output will be similar to the one shown below, the *IP* will normally appear on the third line after the term ``inet``:
```
docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default
    link/ether 02:42:a3:bf:97:21 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:a3ff:febf:9721/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

If the IP is different, use the one that is on your ``docker0``.

## Viewing metrics in grafana

As the service is declared in [Grafana Values](templates/grafana/grafana-values.yml.j2), it has already been instantiated. Then just access the service at the URL http://localhost:3000.

**User**: ``admin``

**Password**: ``admin``

[Grafana](http://localhost:3000)
