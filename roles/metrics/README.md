# Observability Stack - Kubernetes

## About

This readme contains the steps for deploying [`Prometheus`](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring application, [`Loki`](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) to aggregation logs, [`Promtail`] ('https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/') agent which ships the contents of local logs to a private Grafana Loki instance or Grafana Cloud and [`Grafana`](https://grafana.com/grafana/) which is used for visualize and analyze metrics and logs generated by Prometheus and Loki.

## Disclaimer

With a focus on improving the service, aiming at greater maintainability and programmability of the solution. We started a refactoring of the service using [`Helm`](https://helm.sh/), initially we are porting grafana and then we will porte all the rest of the observability solution.

As the inclusion of services (Prometheus, Loki, Promtail and Grafana) is under development, some services are currently not being monitored. The following describes the services already implemented.

## Node Exporter

[`Node Exporter`](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) is used for get host metrics from the host itself. In other words, the metrics obtained by Prometheus are directly related to hardware and operating system.

Available metrics:

* Service uptime;
* Number of CPU cores;
* Total amount of RAM;
* Total amount of containers;
* Disk usage percentage;
* RAM usage percentage;
* Total amount of SWAP;
* Network traffic (Sent and Received);
* CPU usage percentage;
* Total, free and avaliable RAM;
* Amount of RAM for I/O processes;
* Used space of available disks.

## cAdvisor

[`cAdvisor`](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) is an exporter developed by Google that provides metrics regarding resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers.

Available metrics:

* Current status of the container: ``Running``, ``Stopped`` and ``Paused``;
* Network traffic received by container;
* Network traffic sent by container;
* Percentage of RAM usage per container;
* Percentage of CPU usage per container;
* RSS Memory Usage per Container;
* RAM consumption table per container;
* Available RAM for each conatainer;
* RAM limit established for each container.

## For Kubernetes

For [`Kubernetes`](https://kubernetes.io/) we have several specific dashboards for monitoring the cluster, nodes, pods and others services, as mentioned below:

* k8s resources namespaces workloads;
* Dojot 100K;
* Locust;
* Vmq cluster;
* Vmq Nodes;
* k8s resources cluster;
* k8s resources namespaces pods;
* k8s resources namespaces pods;
* k8s resources workloads;
* k8s nodes;
* k8s persistent volumes;
* k8s pods;
* k8s statefulsets;
* k8s usemethod cluster;
* k8s usemethod node.

## How to view and access data in grafana?


* If you are using dojot in a local cluster, just access the grafana service through the URL http://localhost:3000 and prometheus via the URL http://localhost:9090.

* However, if you do not have local access to the cluster, to access the services of prometheus and grafana, simply open an ``SSH`` tunnel using the ``IP`` of the service. To get the ``IP`` of the services run the commands below and search for ``Endpoints`` from the command output:

```
kubectl describe service grafana -n dojot-monitoring
```

and

```
kubectl describe service prometheus-server -n dojot-monitoring
```

* After that, just open an ssh tunnel with the endpoint obtained, for example:

# Prometheus

ssh -L <portlocal>:<endpoint_service_prometheus>:9090 <user_cluster>@<ip_cluster>

Example: 

ssh -L 9090:10.200.40.100:9090 myuser@11:210.44.110

# Grafana

ssh -L <portlocal>:<endpoint_service_prometheus>:3000 <user_cluster>:<ip_cluster>

Example:

ssh -L 3000:10.200.40.100:3000 myuser@11:210.44.110


# User and password to access grafana
